1)      [Root] Identify all LUNs that will be used for database storage.  All LUNs should be of similar geometry and size.
2)      [Root] Verify that the LUNs are configured for use by Oracle ASM:
a.       Verify that a PVID is NOT assigned to the LUNs being used.  Use lspv to determine if a PVID is assigned.  For example,
# lspv | grep hdiskpower6
hdiskpower0       none        None
If a PVID exists on the LUN, then it needs to be removed.  (First verify that the LUN is not being used.)  For Example,
# chdev –l hdiskpower5 pv=clear
Note: If this is on VIO, this step does not need to be performed.
b.      Verify that the “reserve_lock” or “reserve_policy” is turned off.   If not, then change it.  For example, using LUNs controlled by EMC PowerPath where reserve_lock is on:
# lsattr -El hdiskpower6 | grep reserve
reserve_lock  yes    Reserve device on open     True 
# chdev -l hdiskpower6 -a reserve_lock=no
hdiskpower4 changed
# lsattr -El hdiskpower6 | grep reserve
reserve_lock  no     Reserve device on open     True

      Note: If this is on VIO, this step does not need to be performed.
 
c.       Create virtual devices for the ASM disk LUNs using the major and minor number for the related PowerPath devices.  For example, using our example setup: 
# mknod /dev/asm_disk1 c 39 6
# mknod /dev/asm_disk2 c 39 7 
# mknod /dev/asm_disk3 c 39 8

3)      [Root] Zero (Null) these devices (on ONE node only), 
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<virtual_device> bs=8192 count=12800
Perform this command for each of the virtual devices defined in step (2).  For example,
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/asm_disk1 bs=8192 count=25000
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/asm_disk2 bs=8192 count=25000 
4)      [Root] Change ownership to oracle:dba and set permissions to 644 for each of the virtual devices.  For example,
# chown oracle:dba /dev/asm_disk1
# chown oracle:dba /dev/asm_disk2
 
 
5)      [Root] RAC NOTE: Perform steps (1), (2), (3), and (5) on all other nodes in the cluster.
