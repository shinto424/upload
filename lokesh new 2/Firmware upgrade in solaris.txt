The steps required to install the firmware on T3-x systems are as follows: 
1. Logon to Solaris on the machine to be patched 
2. Mount the directory where the patches are located 

# /sbin/mount –o ro <patchserver>:<patchsetbasedir>/Patches /mnt 
3. Copy the sysfwdownload binary and firmware image to a temporary directory 

# cp /mnt/Sun/Firmware/<patchname>/sysfwdownload /tmp 
# cp /mnt/Sun/Firmware/<patchname>/<firmware_image> /tmp 
4. Download the firmware image to the system controller, this will take several minutes 

# /tmp/sysfwdownload /tmp/<firmware_image> 
5. Ensure that any current LDom configuration is saved in the SC[ldm add-config <config-name>] 
6. Ensure any guest domains, and particularly the secondary IO domain (if configured) is shutdown, then shutdown the Solaris system: 

# shutdown –i0 –g0 –y 
7. Power off the system (if the host was halted the power may already have been removed): 

-> stop /SYS 
8. Check that power if off (this can take a few minutes) 

-> show /SYS 
9. Check the keyswitch state of the machine (if the first command shows keyswitch_state not Normal, reset using the second command) 

-> show /SYS keyswitch_state 
-> set /SYS keyswitch_state=Normal 
10. Verify the image is for the correct platform (the sysfwdownload utility does not verify the file and platform match during the download) 

-> show /SP/firmware/localimage 
Good image output (blank lines suppressed): 
/SP/firmware/localimage 
Targets: 
Properties: 
upload_date = Tue Sep 25 11:10:15 2012 
version = 3.0.16.8 
Commands: 
cd 
show 
Bad image output (blank lines suppressed): 
/SP/firmware/localimage 
Targets: 
Properties: 
upload_date = Tue Sep 25 11:32:26 2012 
version = Invalid Image for this Platform 
Commands: 
cd 
show 
11. Record the values of the variables listed in Appendix C 
12. Provided you have the correct firmware image loaded you can then install it 

-> load -source /SP/firmware/localimage 
13. The load command will output two prompts (answer y to both) 

Are you sure you want to load the specified file (y/n)? 
Do you want to preserve the configuration (y/n)? 
14. Once the firmware has been uploaded the SC will be reset (if connected via the network the connection will be lost). 
15. Check the values of the variables listed in Appendix C and reset as necessary, it is expected that the HOST/bootmode config will need to be reset to the appropriate value. 
16. The Solaris environment can then be restarted using: 

-> start /SYS
